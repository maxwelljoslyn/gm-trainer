GM Trainer offers a sandbox environment for RPG Game Masters (GMs) to practice the skills of spontaneous creativity. It uses LLMs to simulate human players' responses to the GM's descriptive narration, giving budding GMs a way to exercise critical skills like improvising descriptions, decisively answering player questions, and giving logical game-world responses to player actions.

Currently, most work at the intersection of RPGs and AI is focused on proof-of-concept attempts to replace the GM -- but a GM is responsible for real-time creation and evolution of an enormous, self-consistent game world, which AIs are nowhere close to achieving.

Being dissatisfied with what I saw in that space, I had the idea that perhaps AI could simulate an RPG player sufficiently well to provide lifelike practice for GMs who want to work on their presentational skills. After only a few days of building and testing this tool, I'm starting to be convinced that this interaction paradigm could have a real impact on how people learn to acquire the nuanced, many-faceted skill of GMing!
