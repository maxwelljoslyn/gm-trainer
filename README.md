## Introduction

GM Trainer offers a sandbox environment for RPG Game Masters (GMs) to practice the skills of spontaneous creativity. It uses LLMs to simulate human players' responses to the GM's descriptive narration, giving budding GMs a way to exercise critical skills like improvising descriptions, decisively answering player questions, and giving logical game-world responses to player actions.

## Rationale

At the intersection of RPGs and AI, **most current work is focused on attempting to replace human GMs** -- but a GM is responsible for real-time creation and evolution of an enormous, self-consistent game world, which AIs are nowhere close to achieving.

Being dissatisfied with what I saw in that space, I thought perhaps AI could simulate an RPG player sufficiently well to provide lifelike practice for GMs who want to work on their presentational skills. While there are still rough edges, I'm starting to be convinced that this interaction paradigm could have a real impact on how people learn to acquire the nuanced, many-faceted skill of GMing!
